1. Establish Base Costs per Square Foot
New Construction:

Basic/Economy: $100-150/sf
Standard/Mid-range: $150-200/sf
High-end/Custom: $200-300+/sf

Renovation:

Light renovation: $50-100/sf
Full renovation: $100-200/sf
Gut renovation: $150-250/sf

2. Apply Complexity Multipliers

Simple projects (basic finishes, standard layout): 0.9-1.0x
Standard projects (mixed finishes, some custom work): 1.0-1.2x
Complex projects (high-end finishes, structural changes): 1.2-1.5x+

3. Location Adjustment
Create a simple location multiplier table:

Rural/Low-cost areas: 0.8-0.9x
Suburban/Average: 1.0x
Urban/High-cost: 1.1-1.3x
Premium markets (SF, NYC, etc.): 1.3-1.6x+

4. Add Buffer for Contingencies
Always add 15-25% contingency for unexpected costs.
Simple Implementation Structure
1. Project Type (New/Renovation)
2. Square Footage
3. Quality Level (Basic/Standard/High-end)
4. Complexity (Simple/Standard/Complex)
5. Location (dropdown with multipliers)
6. Calculate: Base × Multipliers × (1 + Contingency %)
This method typically gets you within 20-30% accuracy for preliminary estimates, which is excellent for initial budgeting and feasibility analysis. The key is regularly updating your base costs with local market data.
